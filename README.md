# eCommerce Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the work done for an eCommerce data analysis assignment. The task involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a Lookalike Model, and implementing customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The dataset includes customer, product, and transaction information, and the goal was to derive actionable insights, recommend similar customers, and segment customers for better business strategy.

## Project Structure

- **Dattatray_Bodake_EDA.ipynb**: Contains the code for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including data cleaning, visualization, and insights derived from the dataset.
- **Dattatray_Bodake_Lookalike.ipynb**: Contains the Lookalike Model development, where customers are recommended based on their profile and transaction history, along with similarity scores.
- **Dattatray_Bodake_Lookalike.csv**: A CSV file containing the top 3 lookalikes with their similarity scores for the first 20 customers.
- **Dattatray_Bodake_Clustering.ipynb**: Contains the customer segmentation/clustering code using transaction and profile data, including the model evaluation.
- **Dattatray_Bodake_Clustering.pdf**: A PDF report summarizing the clustering results, including the number of clusters, DB Index, and visualization of clusters.

## Deliverables

- Jupyter notebooks for EDA, Lookalike Model, and Clustering.
- PDF reports containing business insights and clustering results.
- CSV file for Lookalike recommendations.

## Evaluation Criteria

The assignment was evaluated based on:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights derived and data visualizations.
- **Lookalike Model**: Quality of recommendations and accuracy of similarity scores.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Logic behind clustering, DB Index, and visual representation of clusters.

## Submission Instructions

All deliverables have been uploaded to this public repository, following the required naming conventions.

## Final Note

This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and providing business insights based on real-world eCommerce data. The models developed aim to assist in improving customer engagement and segmentation strategies for businesses.
